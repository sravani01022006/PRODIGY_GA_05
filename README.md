# Neural Style Transfer - Abstract Edition

This project demonstrates how to **apply the style of an expressive or abstract painting** (like *The Scream* or *Kandinskyâ€™s art*) onto a real-world photo using **Neural Style Transfer** with PyTorch.

## What is Neural Style Transfer?

Neural Style Transfer uses a pre-trained deep learning model (VGG19) to:
- Extract **content** from a base image
- Extract **style** (colors, textures, brush strokes) from an artwork
- Merge both to create a **stylized output image**

## How to Run It

You can run this project in **Google Colab** or any Python environment with `torch` and `torchvision`.

1. Upload your own content & style image
2. Run the script (or notebook)
3. Download the AI-stylized output
